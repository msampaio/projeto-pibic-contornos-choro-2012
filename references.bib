@phdthesis{Marvin1988,
  abstract =     {This dissertation proposes the thesis that abstract
                  theories of pitch- and set-class structure do not
                  reflect listeners' aural perception of sounding
                  music as effectively as theories modelling the
                  articulation of these underlying structures on the
                  musical surface. This position is supported by a
                  review of pertinent music-theoretical and
                  music-psychological research. Based upon the data
                  collected by various music-psychologists, published
                  elsewhere but compared and critiqued here, this
                  study concludes that listeners generally use figural
                  cues drawn from musical context --- for example,
                  melodic shapes, changes of direction, relative
                  durationnal patterns, and so on --- to retain and
                  recognize musical ideas in short-term memory. These
                  figural cues may be represented in precise notation
                  and compared with one another by application and
                  generalization of Robert Morris's contour
                  theories. Morris's comparison matrix and contour
                  equivalence relations are introduced here, followed
                  by this author's generalization of the thwory to
                  duration space and development of similarity
                  relations for melodic contours of relative pitch
                  height and rhythmic contours of relative suration
                  successions. The similarity relations for musical
                  contours build upon previous wort of Dabid Lewin,
                  Robert Morris, and John Rahn. While the efficacy of
                  these theories for modelling perceivable patterns in
                  musical contexts cannot be proven without further
                  psychological testing, their applicability to
                  musical analysis is demonstrated. Analyses drawn
                  form the music of Bartok, Webern, Berg, and
                  Var\`{e}se illustrate ways in which melodic and
                  rhythmic contour relationships may be used to shape
                  a formal scheme to differentiate melody from
                  accompaniment, to associate musical ideas that
                  belong to different set classes, and to create unity
                  throuth varied repetition. The concluding chapter
                  explores avenues for future work. A section on
                  music-psychological experimentation offers a
                  critical overview of research in this area and
                  proposes ideas for future experimentation. Second,
                  the implications of music-psychological research for
                  the pedagogy of non-tonal music theory are
                  considered and a model curriculum for non-tonal
                  music theory proposed. The dissertation concludes by
                  proposing a number of ways in which contour theory
                  might be generalized to other domains and
                  illustrates the application of one such
                  generalization to the analysis of chord spacing in a
                  piano work of Luigi Dallapiccola.},
